# Crypto Alert Service

[![CI](https://github.com/badenkov/crypto_alert_service/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/badenkov/crypto_alert_service/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This is a test task (homework).
Build a personal crypto-alert service

Features:

- the user creates alerts (what symbol | crosses what threshold price | up or down) and manages them
- the user sets up and manages notification channels (write to a log / send an email / send a message to Telegram / send a browser notification / send an OS-notification / send to a message broker / â€¦)
- the user receives notifications when the price crosses the threshold
